# **Keycloak & Spring Boot Microservices: Interview Summary**

**Core Concept:**
Securing microservices involves centralizing authentication/authorization with an **Authorization Server** (Keycloak) and implementing **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC)** flows. The **API Gateway** acts as the primary enforcement point, validating tokens before forwarding requests to downstream **Resource Servers** (your microservices).

-----

### **I. Keycloak Setup (The Authorization Server)**

1.  **Deployment:** Run Keycloak (e.g., Docker, standalone `kc.sh start-dev`). Default port is 8080.
2.  **Realm Creation:**
    * Create a dedicated realm (e.g., `spring-microservices-realm`) for your application's users and clients. Avoid using the `master` realm.
    * **Purpose:** Provides isolation for users, clients, and roles specific to your application.
3.  **Client Registration:**
    * Register a "Client" in Keycloak for your **API Gateway** (e.g., `gateway-client`).
    * **Crucial Setting: Access Type**
        * **`Confidential` (Common for API Gateway):** If your Gateway initiates client credential flows or acts as a full OIDC client, it requires a `client_secret`. This is often the case for server-side applications.
        * **`Public` (Simpler for pure Resource Server):** If the Gateway *only* validates tokens issued to other clients (e.g., a browser SPA or mobile app), a secret isn't needed.
    * **Direct Access Grants Enabled:** **ON** (essential for using `grant_type: password` in Postman/cURL for direct user login testing).
    * **Standard Flow Enabled:** **ON** if you're building a traditional web app or SPA that uses Keycloak for login (browser-based redirects).
    * **Valid Redirect URIs / Web Origins:** Configure these carefully. `Valid Redirect URIs` are where Keycloak can redirect the user's browser after successful authentication. `Web Origins` are for CORS policies, allowing JavaScript from specific origins to interact with Keycloak. Use `*` for development/testing, but be specific in production.
4.  **User Creation:** Create users within your realm (e.g., `testuser`) and set their credentials (password, ensuring "Temporary" is OFF).
5.  **Endpoint Discovery:**
    * Locate the Realm's OIDC discovery endpoint (`.well-known/openid-configuration`).
    * **How to find:** In Keycloak Admin Console, go to "Realm settings" -\> "Endpoints" tab -\> Click the "OpenID Endpoint Configuration" link/button.
    * **Key Information:** Note the `issuer` URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/realms/spring-microservices-realm`) and `jwks_uri` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/realms/spring-microservices-realm/protocol/openid-connect/certs`). Spring Security uses these to validate JWTs.

-----

### **II. Spring Boot Microservices Integration**

#### **A. Maven Dependencies (`pom.xml` for each relevant service)**

* **For all secured services (API Gateway, Microservice1, Microservice2):**
  ```xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ```
* **API Gateway specific `pom.xml`:**
    * Use the standard Spring Cloud Gateway starter, which relies on WebFlux:
      ```xml
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      ```
    * **Crucial Exclusion (Spring Boot 3.x+):** To prevent classpath conflicts (`TransportClientFactories` error) and ensure compatibility with newer Spring Cloud versions:
      ```xml
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
          <exclusions>
              <exclusion>
                  <groupId>com.netflix.eureka</groupId>
                  <artifactId>eureka-client-jersey2</artifactId>
              </exclusion>
          </exclusions>
      </dependency>
      ```
    * **NO `spring-boot-starter-web` in Gateway:** This is critical. The standard `spring-cloud-starter-gateway` depends on `spring-boot-starter-webflux`. Having both `web` (Spring MVC) and `webflux` (Reactive) starters on the classpath for the same application leads to conflicts and startup failures (e.g., "Spring MVC found on classpath, which is incompatible with Spring Cloud Gateway").

#### **B. Application Properties (`application.properties` in each secured service)**

* **OAuth2 Resource Server:** Point to your Keycloak realm's issuer URI. Spring Security will automatically discover the `jwks_uri` from this endpoint to fetch public keys for JWT signature verification.
  ```properties
  spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://localhost:8080/realms/your-realm-name
  ```
* **Eureka Configuration:** Standard Eureka client settings.
  ```properties
  spring.application.name=your-service-name
  eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
  ```
* **API Gateway specific properties:**
    * Adjust `server.port` (e.g., `server.port=8085`) to avoid conflict with Keycloak's default 8080.
    * Configure gateway routes using the `spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.*` prefix (as warned by newer Spring Cloud Gateway versions):
      ```properties
      spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.discovery.locator.enabled=true
      spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.routes[0].id=my-route
      spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.routes[0].uri=lb://my-target-service
      spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.routes[0].predicates[0]=Path=/my-prefix/**
      spring.cloud.gateway.server.webflux.routes[0].filters[0]=RewritePath=/my-prefix/(?<remaining>.*), /${remaining}
      ```

#### **C. Spring Security Configuration (`@Configuration` classes)**

This is where you define security rules and enable OAuth2 resource server functionality.

1.  **API Gateway (`ApiGatewayApplication` / `SecurityConfig.java`)**

    * **Purpose:** Filters all incoming requests, validates JWTs, and applies initial access control based on paths.
    * **Annotations:**
        * `@Configuration`: Marks the class as a Spring configuration bean.
        * `@EnableWebFluxSecurity`: **Crucial for the API Gateway**, as it uses Spring WebFlux (reactive stack).
    * **`SecurityWebFilterChain` Bean:**
      ```java
      @Bean
      public SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
          http
              .csrf(ServerHttpSecurity.CsrfSpec::disable) // Disable CSRF for stateless REST APIs. CSRF tokens are typically for browser-based forms, not API calls with Bearer tokens.
              .authorizeExchange(exchanges -> exchanges
                  // Allow public access to Eureka health/info endpoints and gateway-specific public paths
                  .pathMatchers("/eureka/**", "/actuator/**", "/public/**").permitAll()
                  // All other requests must be authenticated (have a valid JWT)
                  .anyExchange().authenticated()
              )
              // Enable OAuth2 Resource Server for JWT validation. It automatically fetches JWKS from issuer-uri.
              .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2.jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));
          return http.build();
      }
      ```

2.  **Downstream Microservices (e.g., `Microservice1Application`, `Microservice2Application` / `SecurityConfig.java`)**

    * **Purpose:** Validates the JWT again (or trusts the Gateway), and performs fine-grained, service-specific authorization.
    * **Annotations:**
        * `@Configuration`
        * `@EnableWebSecurity`: **Crucial for standard Spring Boot services**, as they typically use Spring WebMVC (servlet API).
        * `@EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)`: **Highly recommended** for method-level security using `@PreAuthorize`, allowing very granular access control based on roles/scopes.
    * **`SecurityFilterChain` Bean:**
      ```java
      @Bean
      public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
          http
              .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable()) // Disable CSRF for stateless REST APIs.
              .authorizeHttpRequests(authorize -> authorize
                  // Example: allow specific paths to be public within this service (e.g., /health)
                  // .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                  // All other requests to this service must be authenticated
                  .anyRequest().authenticated()
              )
              // Enable OAuth2 Resource Server for JWT validation.
              .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2.jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));
          return http.build();
      }
      ```

#### **D. Controller Usage (Downstream Microservices)**

* **Accessing Authentication Details:** Inject `Authentication` or `@AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt` into controller methods.
  ```java
  import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
  import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
  import org.springframework.security.oauth2.jwt.Jwt;
  import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;

  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api/v1/")
  public class MyController {

      @GetMapping("secured-data")
      @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_read')") // Method-level authorization: user must have 'read' scope/authority
      public String getSecuredData(Authentication authentication, @AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt) {
          String username = authentication.getName(); // Extracts 'sub' claim (subject)
          // Authorities typically mapped from 'scope' claim (e.g., "openid profile email" -> SCOPE_openid, SCOPE_profile, SCOPE_email)
          Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> authorities = authentication.getAuthorities();
          Map<String, Object> claims = jwt.getClaims(); // Access all JWT claims (e.g., 'email', 'preferred_username')

          return "Secured data for user: " + username + " with authorities: " + authorities.toString();
      }
  }
  ```
    * **`SCOPE_` Prefix:** Spring Security automatically prefixes scopes from the JWT (e.g., `read`) with `SCOPE_` (e.g., `SCOPE_read`) when converting them to `GrantedAuthority` objects. This is important for `@PreAuthorize` expressions.

### **III. Key Concepts & Interview Points**

* **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC):**
    * **OAuth 2.0:** An authorization *framework* for delegated access. It's about granting access to protected resources without sharing credentials.
    * **OIDC:** An identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. It enables clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token):**
    * A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
    * **Stateless:** After issuance, no server-side session lookup is needed. The token itself contains all necessary information (user ID, roles, expiry), making it ideal for distributed microservices.
    * **Signed:** Contains a digital signature (usually JWS) to ensure integrity and authenticity. Validated using the Authorization Server's public key (fetched from `jwks_uri`).
* **Roles of Services:**
    * **Authorization Server (Keycloak):** Centralized identity provider; handles user authentication, token issuance (JWTs), and user/client management.
    * **API Gateway (Resource Server):** The primary entry point for all client requests. Its role is to:
        * **Validate incoming JWTs:** Verifies signature, expiry, issuer, and audience.
        * **Initial Authorization:** Performs coarse-grained access checks (e.g., "is this path accessible with *any* valid token?").
        * **Routing:** Forwards validated requests to the correct downstream microservice using Eureka for discovery.
        * **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Centralizes other security features like rate limiting, basic CORS policy enforcement, and potentially logging.
    * **Downstream Microservices (Resource Servers):** Backend services that expose business logic. Their role is to:
        * **Re-validate JWTs:** While the Gateway validates, downstream services should also validate the token (or trust the Gateway's validation if using a secure internal network and specific trust models like opaque tokens, which is more advanced). This provides defense-in-depth.
        * **Fine-Grained Authorization:** Apply specific business-logic-driven access control (e.g., "can this user update *this specific* record?") using `@PreAuthorize` based on roles/scopes in the JWT.
* **Why use an API Gateway for Security?**
    * **Single Enforcement Point:** All external traffic passes through it, simplifying security policy management.
    * **Decoupling:** Microservices don't need direct knowledge of the Identity Provider; they only need to trust the tokens issued by the configured issuer.
    * **Reduced Boilerplate:** Avoids repeating common security logic in every microservice.
    * **Improved Performance:** Can cache public keys and perform quick validation.
* **Feign Client (Inter-service Communication):**
    * Spring Security's OAuth2 resource server integration often automatically propagates the `Authentication` context (including the JWT) for internal `RestTemplate` or Feign client calls within your microservice landscape. This means a downstream service receiving a request from an upstream service (that received a JWT) will still have the user's security context available. This simplifies chained service calls.
* **HTTPS/TLS Everywhere:** Crucial for all communication (client-to-gateway, gateway-to-microservice, microservice-to-microservice) to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
